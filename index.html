        <p class="two">We all know what it`s like to feel homesick. But has anyone ever felt so homesick that they`ve bought a small wooden crate and convinced two men by the name of Paul and John to stow them aboard a Qantas freight plane to the UK? Yes, and his name is Brian Robson. In 1965, 19-year-old Brian was working for Victorian Railways in Australia and really hated it. He wanted to go back to London, but he couldn’t afford the £700 plane ticket. Instead, he packed himself into a box with a pillow, suitcase, and a book of Beatles songs and had Paul and John nail it shut before labelling the package as a computer and booking it onto a flight from Melbourne.

            Brian even took laxatives for a few days leading up to his departure so he wouldn`t have to relieve himself on board, but things took a turn for the worst when the box ended up on a PanAm flight to LAX instead, and he was eventually discovered by an airport worker five days later. He then spent another five days in hospital before questioned by the FBI and finally, deported back to the UK.</p>
